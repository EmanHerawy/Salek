Our cross-chain DeFi solution enables seamless token swaps through two key components it facilitates decentralized token swaps within a Uniswap V4-based pool and supports cross-chain token transfers via Chainlink's CCIP protocol. It integrates Uniswap V4 hooks and Chainlink's price feed and CCIP infrastructure to provide a robust mechanism for cross-chain interoperability. . The front-end mini app provides a user-friendly interface for specifying source and destination tokens and swap amounts (TO BE ADDED). It integrates with the 1inch Fusion API for optimal routing, MEV protection, real-time price impact, and gas fee estimates across chains. 

The system's backbone is a robust smart contract infrastructure utilizing Uniswap v4 and Chainlink's CCIP. When a swap is initiated, source tokens are locked, and a secure cross-chain message with swap details is sent via CCIP to the destination chain. There, smart contracts execute the swap using Uniswap v4â€™s advanced routing and liquidity features.

How it's Made
Backend: Engineered smart contracts utilizing Uniswap v4's hooks for custom swap logic and Chainlink's CCIP for secure cross-chain messaging. The contracts handle token locking on source chains, cross-chain message transmission, and swap execution on destination chains. Key technical integrations

## Features
Token Swap: Allows token swaps within Uniswap V4 pools, supporting ETH-to-token and token-to-token pairs.
Cross-Chain Support: Integrates Chainlink's CCIP protocol to enable cross-chain token transfers.
Dynamic Fee Calculation: Uses Chainlink price feeds to dynamically calculate fees in ETH for LINK transactions.
Uniswap V4 Hooks: Implements the afterSwap hook to execute cross-chain transfers post-swap.
Secure Pool Management: Includes a mechanism to reduce potential abuse from repeated token swaps to drain liquidity.
