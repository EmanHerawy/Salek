Our cross-chain DeFi solution enables seamless token swaps through two key components. The front-end mini app provides a user-friendly interface for specifying source and destination tokens and swap amounts (TO BE ADDED). It integrates with the 1inch Fusion API for optimal routing, MEV protection, real-time price impact, and gas fee estimates across chains.

The system's backbone is a robust smart contract infrastructure utilizing Uniswap v4 and Chainlink's CCIP. When a swap is initiated, source tokens are locked, and a secure cross-chain message with swap details is sent via CCIP to the destination chain. There, smart contracts execute the swap using Uniswap v4â€™s advanced routing and liquidity features.

How it's Made
Backend: Engineered smart contracts utilizing Uniswap v4's hooks for custom swap logic and Chainlink's CCIP for secure cross-chain messaging. The contracts handle token locking on source chains, cross-chain message transmission, and swap execution on destination chains. Key technical integrations
